My name is Nick, I'm a senior at the University of Michigan studying computer
science through the College of Engineering. Besides computers, I'm interested in
linguistics and foreign language, and I'm pursuing a minor in Spanish.

I spent the past summer working for Palantir Technologies in Palo Alto, CA as a
forward deployed engineering intern, and will be returning full-time in 2016.
I have previously worked at Quicken Loans in Detroit and for Yottabyte in
Bloomfield Hills, and also dabble in development on my own.

Outside of school I've been involved with the MHacks sponsorship team and some
lesser known groups on campus. I've been snowboarding for 10 years and am
looking to get in to skiing. I also love music, particularly classic rock and
black metal.
