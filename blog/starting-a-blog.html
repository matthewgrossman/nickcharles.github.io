        <p>Over the past year or two I've really started to enjoy reading about other people's personal experiences. Inspired by Steve Yegge's post <a class="link" href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs">You Should Write Blogs</a>, I've decided to start a blog of my own. I'll try to collect my thoughts on computer science and programming alongside my experiences with various companies, internships, events, and industry in general. It is my goal to not only educate others who are following the software profession, but also to organize my own ideas and concerns with the software engineering industry. I will discuss software engineering in general and the various quirks associated with it, along with school projects and internship experiences. This may also come with political opinions and comments on the various frameworks and tools that I may use on projects in the future. My hope is that this proves useful for those who are in the software industry, as well as those who are considering a career associated with software in the future.</p>

        <p>My contact information is included on my resume page and I encourage constructive criticism and feedback.</p>
