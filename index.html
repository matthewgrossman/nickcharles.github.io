          <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
            My name is Nick, I'm a junior at the University of Michigan studying 
            computer science through the College of Engineering. Besides computers, 
            I'm interested in linguistics and foreign language, and I'm pursuing a minor in Spanish.
            </p>
            <p>
            I live in Ann Arbor, MI and spent the summer of 2014 working as a 
            software engineering intern at Quicken Loans. I have previously interned 
            at Yottabyte in Bloomfield Hills and also dabble in development on my own.
            </p>
            <p>
            Outside of school I am involved with the MHacks sponsorship team and 
            am also a captain of the University of Michigan Ski Team. I've been 
            snowboarding for 10 years and am looking to get in to skiing. 
            I love music, particularly classic rock and black metal.
